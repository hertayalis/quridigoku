He was linked to a terrible mass shooting in Jacksonville Dollar General Store. This event was shocking because it seemed driven by hatred against Black people.</p><p>On that day, Ryan, who was 21 years old and white, went into the Dollar General store wearing a special vest and carrying a handgun and AR-style rifle. What was even scarier was that the rifle had symbols on it that were associated with hate and bad things. Sadly, he shot and killed three Black people who were in the store at that time. After the shooting, Ryan turned the gun on himself and ended his own life.</p><p>People were left really sad and worried about what had happened. The police officer in charge, Sheriff TK Waters, said that the shooting was clearly driven by racism. He said that Ryan had strong hate against Black people. It was really shocking to hear that Ryan had planned this and was targeting Black people.</p><p>The people who were hurt in this terrible event were not given their names by the police right away. But the sheriff did tell us that they were all Black. This makes it really clear that Ryan had something against Black people.</p><p>Sheriff Waters said that Ryan was like a crazy person who wanted to end lives, and he had a strong focus on hurting Black people.</p><p>Read Also:<a href=# rel=noopener> Melissa Dunham: Ohio Accountant, Her Businessman Husband, and Their Children Found Dead</a></p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Ryan Palmeter Father Steve palmeter and Mother Maryann Palmeter" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ryan-Palmeter-Father-Steve-palmeter-and-Mother-Maryann-Palmeter.webp alt="Ryan Palmeter Father Steve palmeter and Mother Maryann Palmeter" width=450 height=402 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Ryan’s Father Contacted Police</strong></h2><p>While the police were initially hesitant to disclose the suspect’s identity, Palmeter’s father, Steve Palmeter<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">,</span>&nbsp;contacted the authorities, confirming his son’s involvement.</p><p>We didn’t know much about Ryan from the things he put online. His Facebook page was gone, and he had only made one post on Twitter a few years ago, talking about going to college.</p><p>We might never fully understand why he did what he did, but it’s clear that he wanted to hurt a specific group of people—Black individuals.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Steve palmeter Tweets" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Steve-palmeter-Tweets.webp alt="Steve palmeter Tweets" width=400 height=495 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Father’s Political Beliefs and Social Media Activity</strong></h2><p>The suspected shooter’s father, Steve Palmeter, has come into the spotlight due to his political inclinations. He has been identified as a registered Democrat, and his views on politics, particularly his feelings toward former President Donald Trump, have become evident through his online presence.</p><p>Steve Palmeter has openly expressed his criticism of Trump and those who support him. On October 2, 2020, he posted a tweet suggesting, “Trump can’t have the Coronavirus, he’s too dumb to pass the test.”</p><p>His frustration with Trump supporters was also evident in a tweet dated May 24, 2022, where he shared his exasperation with individuals who aligned themselves with the MAGA movement.</p><p>In his words, “I’ve had this mother/daughter MAGA idiots going crazy for 5 days now. They may be sisters, kinda hard to tell. The violent threats started on the 2nd day.” Interestingly, he recently deleted his account on the social media platform X (Twitter).</p><h2><strong>Left His Parent’s Home</strong></h2><p>After the unfortunate shooting at the Dollar General store, we’ve learned some new things. The person who did the shooting is named Ryan Palmeter.</p><p>Several law enforcement sources identified him. Someone who knows much about the investigation told us that Ryan left something troubling at his parent’s house before the shooting happened. He also posted a picture on social media one day before the terrible event.</p><p>The person said, “We found a paper at Ryan Palmeter’s parents’ house. This paper shows that he had been planning this for a while, which makes this already really sad situation even more complicated.” This means that Ryan had been thinking about doing this lousy thing before he did it.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Ryan Palmeter Enterned First Edward Waters University" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ryan-Palmeter-Enterned-First-Edward-Waters-University.webp alt="Ryan Palmeter Enterned First Edward Waters University" width=400 height=404 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Palmeter Spotted on Edward Waters University Campus</strong></h2><p>Just moments before the Dollar General Mass Shooting unfolded, Ryan Palmeter’s presence was noted on the campus of Edward Waters University (EWU).</p><p>He was seen behind the university’s library, where he was observed putting on a ballistics vest. Interestingly, despite this activity, campus security did not apprehend him, as the television station shared.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Ryan’s name wasn’t explicitly mentioned in this report.</p><p>Following this, Sheriff TK Waters revealed that the suspect indeed donned a vest and a mask before heading straight to the Dollar General store.</p><p>Despite this revelation, the reason for his presence on the university campus remained a mystery. While Sheriff Waters confirmed that he was there, the purpose behind his actions remained unclear.</p><p>During these events, the suspect was seen wearing gloves, a mask, and a “tactical vest.” The university itself is recognized as a “historically Black private Christian school,” according to CNN’s coverage.</p><p>A witness who shared their account with News4Jax stated that the suspect had fired shots at cars in the Dollar General parking lot before entering the store.</p><p>Edward Waters University&nbsp;released a statement&nbsp;on its Facebook page:</p><p>Earlier today, there was a fatal off-campus shooting on Kings Road near the EWU campus. Preliminary reports do not implicate the involvement of students, faculty, or staff. The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office is at the scene, and our campus police have secured all campus facilities. Students are being kept in their residence halls through the afternoon until the scene is cleared.</p><p>The EWU Tiger Alert system has been activated to notify the campus community and implement a campus-wide stay-in-place order. Further information and details will be forthcoming via EWU email, website, and social media as more information is received from local JSO law enforcement and campus security.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Ryan Palmeter Twitter" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ryan-Palmeter-Twitter.webp alt="Ryan Palmeter Twitter" width=450 height=297 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Palmeter Had a 3.5 GPA</strong></h2><p>His Twitter bio showcases a multifaceted persona – a former attendee of Oakleaf High School in Orange Park, Florida, maintaining a respectable 3.5 GPA.</p><p>Alongside this, he proudly declares his certification in graphic design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator CS6, and Adobe InDesign. Adding a touch of humor, he mentions his penchant for AriZona products.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Flagler College Student Ryan Palmeter" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flagler-College-Student-Ryan-Palmeter.webp alt="Flagler College Student Ryan Palmeter" width=450 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In a post from 2019, Ryan Palmeter’s aspirations pointed toward a future in Business Administration, an ambition underscored by his excitement and a shared letter from Flagler College. The letter hints at his affiliation with the institution, marking a significant chapter in his journey.</p><h2><strong>Previous Emergency Mental Health Detention</strong></h2><p>In shedding light on the Dollar General Mass Shooting suspect’s background, it was revealed by the Sheriff that there were earlier incidents involving the individual.</p><p>Notably, in 2016, there was a domestic call in Clay County that concerned the suspect. However, this incident didn’t lead to an arrest, and further details weren’t provided by the Sheriff.</p><p>Another facet of the suspect’s past came to the fore – in 2017, he was subjected to something called the Baker Act. This is a law in Florida designed to address emergency mental health situations.</p><h3><strong>Ryan Palmeter FAQs</strong></h3><p>Ques: Who was the Jacksonville Dollar General Store Mass Shooting Suspect?</p><p>Ans: Ryan Palmeter.</p><p>Ques: How old was Ryan Palmeter?</p><p>Ans: He was 21 years old.</p><p>Ques: Who Confirmed Ryan Palmeter’s identity?</p><p>Ans: His Father.</p><p>Ques: Ryan Palmeter was a student of which college?</p><p>Ans: Flagler College.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsr5WauG%2BvzqZmq7GRo3qxrcumnK2domQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./emma-stone-silver-slip-dress-lilac-duster-poor-things-screening-8416380.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emma Stone Took a Surprising Approach to Holiday Dressing in a Silver Slip Dress and Lilac Duster">&larr;
