He is highly respected in his profession and has won numerous awards and accolades so far.</p><p>Some rumors have been going around about his ethnicity, some proclaiming that he is of Asian heritage. Let us debunk those for you, and find out Ryan Day’s ethnic background.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Ryan_Days_Ethnicity_And_Nationality><strong>Ryan Day’s Ethnicity And Nationality</strong></span></h2><p>Ryan Day is of white American descent and his family has a long history in New Hampshire. Although some declare that he might be Asian, that is simply not true. Born and raised in Manchester, New Hampshire, Day attended the University of New Hampshire, where he played quarterback and linebacker for the Wildcats. He commenced his coaching career in 2002 and, since then has coached at several different colleges and universities. He was named the head coach at Ohio State in 2019.</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Ryann Patrick Day</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Roman-Catholic</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Lisa Day and Raymond Day</td></tr><tr><td>Language</td><td>English</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Ryan_Days_Family_Background><strong>Ryan Day’s Family Background</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportzhive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ryan-Day-Race-and-Faith.jpg><p>Ryan was born on March 12, 1979, in Manchester, New Hampshire. His father, Raymond, died by suicide when Ryan was only eight years old. Raymond ran a convenience store, and his death definitely left a big hole in Ryan’s life. He has spoken publicly about his mental struggle due to the trauma. Since then he has advocated for breaking the stigma associated with mental health</p><p>“When you’re young … you go through a range of emotions: from angry to sad to resentment. Then as you get older, you start to realize … it was a sickness, and there are people out there that need help,” he told reporters.</p><p>Ryan Day’s mom, Lisa Day, is a retired teacher who raised Ryan and his two younger brothers, Chris and Tim as a single parent. Chris is a DEA agent and Tim is a Distributor principal at Alphatec Spine, and both are successful in their respective fields.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Ryan_Days_Faith><strong>Ryan Day’s Faith</strong></span></h2><p>Although Ryan Day has not publicly disclosed his religious views, he grew up as a Roman Catholic and said that faith played a vital role in his life, career, and spirituality. “Among the things I’ve shared with my family is that faith comes from within, It’s about your relationship with God.”</p><p>Ohio State doesn’t have an official religion, but it does have a culture of relationship, community, and spirituality. They deem college football as a religion and try not to force their theocracy on others.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Ryan_Days_Coaching_Career><strong>Ryan Day’s Coaching Career</strong></span></h2><p>Ryan Day’s coaching career began in 2002 when he was hired as a graduate assistant at Boston College.
