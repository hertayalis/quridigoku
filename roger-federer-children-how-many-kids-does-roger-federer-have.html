I never saw myself in a vision as a tennis player and father and husband at the same time,”&nbsp;Federer once said.</p><p>His girls aren’t really interested in tennis, but one of his boys shows some interest in the sport.&nbsp;“Yeah one of them, the other three (gesturing dicy). One is on a strike right now, he hasn’t played tennis in two months, doesn’t want to do it, you know which one,”&nbsp;Federer said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqumoJ2iYrOmsMSrnKtlk522rbDRnqVmoJ%2Bseq6tzbJkpKGUqHqlu8SsZKunl5q%2FbrLEnZyrnaJitaLCxGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shaquille-leonard-partner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shaquille Leonard Partner: Who Is Kayla Leonard?">&larr;
