Stevenson has had a varied career, working in both film and television in both the U.K. and the U.S. One of his most well-known roles for many is that from the MCU, as a warrior in <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=641 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The actor recently passed away</a> whilst shooting the film&nbsp;Cassino on Ischia in Italy, just four days shy of his 59th birthday. He started off his career by studying at the prestigious Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in England, a school founded by Lawrence Olivier that has produced excellent actors over the decades such as Daniel Day-Lewis, Olivia Coleman, and Josh O’Connor. He then went on to star in a number of British dramas before getting his big break in the 1998 film The Theory of Flight. He was then cast in the Hollywood film King Authur which helped his career take off across the pond, including finding a spot in the MCU.</p><h2 id=h-ray-stevenson-s-role-in-thor data-injectable=false>Ray Stevenson’s role in ‘Thor’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ray-Stevenson-Volstagg-Thor.jpg><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>While Stevenson has acted in many well-known roles, to this day he is probably best known for his role in the Thor franchise. The first film introduced us to the Asgardian God of Thunder and his companions, Lady Sif and the Warriors Three, Fandral the Dashing, Hogun the Grim, and Volstagg the Valiant. It was the latter of those characters that was played by Stevenson, appearing in the first three Thor films from 2011 to 2022.</p><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>Stevenson was already known for his strong build and was a great fit to play the axe-wielding Asgardian that fought alongside Thor. Think Gimli from Lord of the Rings but a hell of a lot taller. Volstagg was a loyal friend of Thor, being the first to agree to join him in his revenge quest to Jotunheim in the first film. Sadly his character was brutally killed off in the third film by Hela, God of Death played by Cate Blanchett. This was not his first Marvel role, as he actually played Frank Castle aka. The Punisher in the 2008 film, Punisher: War Zone.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>Marvel is not the only huge franchise that Stevenson worked within, having brought to life multiple characters in the Star Wars universe. He has provided the voice of the treacherous Mandalorian Gar Saxon in Star Wars Rebels as well as in and&nbsp;Star Wars: The Clone Wars. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is set to star in the upcoming live-action series Ahsoka</a> as the former Jedi, Baylan Skoll which will air in August, all of his parts having been filmed and finished.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>His sudden passing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has shocked many in the industry</a> as well as fans across the globe who are sharing their own favorite Stevenson roles on social media. He has certainly been a part of some well-loved franchises and he will be sorely missed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahpmacmZl6s63YZqqtnaaau7S7zWanpZmpYravedOhpqtn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-rafael-santos-borres-spouse-meet-ana-caicedo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Rafael Santos Borrs Spouse?
