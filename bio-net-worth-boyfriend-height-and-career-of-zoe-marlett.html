She became well-known around the world after giving a standout performance as Anna in the Netflix series “Black Summer,” in which she paired up with Jaime King for both of the show’s seasons.</strong></p><p>Karl Schaefer and John Hyams are the show’s creators, and the second season will debut on June 17th, 2021. Rose, a significant character in the show played by Jaime King, is the mother of Zoe’s character. The devoted daughter of Patrick (played by Ty Olsson) and Rose are named Anna.</p><p>John Hyams and Abram Cox were the directors of this young actress. I’ll try to give you a quick biography of Marlett and her rise to stardom on Netflix in this piece.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Zoe_Marlett>What is the Net Worth of Zoe Marlett?</span></h2><p>As of December 2022, Zoe Marlett’s net worth was estimated to be between <strong>$300,000 and USD 350,000.</strong></p><h2><span id=Biography_of_Zoe_Marlett>Biography of Zoe Marlett</span></h2><p>Zoe Marlett was born to adore Canadian parents on <strong>May 8, 2005</strong>, in Vancouver, British Columbia. She is a Taurus, an earth sign, and she is 16 years old as of 2021. However, Zoe’s views on the sun sign do not persuade me.</p><p>Tauruses are seen as being pragmatists, loyal, and patient. Some trustworthy websites claim that their fortunate days are Friday and Monday. She is a Canadian citizen and was born into a family of Christians.</p><p>Christina Marlett, her mother, and Paul Marlett, her father, were both born to this young and beautiful actress with whom she has a strong relationship. Her mother helps her balance her work and schooling, and both of her parents are fully supportive of her acting career.</p><p>On June 15, 2008, Christina and Paul gave birth to Oakley Marlett, Zoe’s younger brother, after waiting three years. The younger sister, Zoe, who has had considerable success at such a young age, is the most down-to-earth of the two.</p><p>She is in the tenth grade and is now pursuing her schooling. On the other hand, Oakley is a seventh-grader. This actress attends her hometown school, according to my sources, but she has never posted the name of the institution online due to privacy concerns.</p><p>I learned that Christina, her mother, is an entrepreneur after perusing her social media profiles. In addition to raising her kids, she also works as a successful company owner, motivational speaker, and coach for self-care.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td><strong>Real Full Name</strong></td><td><strong>Zoe Marlett.</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Occupation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Voice Artist and Actress.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age (as of 2021)</strong></td><td>16 years.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birthday</strong></td><td>May 8, 2005 (Sunday, Mother’s Day).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Place of Birth</strong></td><td>Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>White.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>Canadian.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Parents</strong></td><td>Father:&nbsp;Paul Marlett.<br>Mother:&nbsp;Christina Marlett.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Brother:&nbsp;Oakley Marlett.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Brown.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Hazel.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height (approx.)</strong></td><td>In feet and inches: 5’ 4”</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight (approx.)</strong></td><td>In Kilograms: 46 Kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hobbies</strong></td><td>Karate and Painting.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net worth (as of 2021)</strong></td><td>$300,000 – $350,000 US Dollars, approx.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=How_did_Zoe_Marlett_start_her_Career>How did Zoe Marlett start her Career?</span></h2><p>When she was employed as a voiceover artist at an early age, Zoe’s professional acting career officially got underway. She appeared in six episodes of the television show Lalaloopsy in 2014 as Pillow Featherbed.</p><p>She was hired to play a daughter in the television movie “Alive” later that year. Rob Grant, her director, oversaw her work. Along with Thomas Cocquerel, Camille Stopps, Angus Macfadyen, Chantal Perron, Gerrick Winston, and Lisa Moreau, Zoe made an appearance in the movie.</p><p>After she was chosen to play the part of Anna, a child who lost her mother during the zombie apocalypse, her career took off.</p><p>The primary cast of Black Summer is completed by Justin Chu Cary as Julius James, Christine Lee as Ooh “Sun” Kyungsun, Sal Velez Jr. as William Velez, Erika Hau as Carmen, Kelsey Flower as Lance, and others.</p><p>In the first season of the program, her character made a brief appearance as a recurrent character; however, in the second episode of Black Summer, Zoe Marlett is one of the main characters. The eighth episode of season one feature Rose battling zombies and making it to the stadium.</p><p>The story continues in Black Summer Part 2 after Anna and her mother were reunited in the concluding scene. This online series, according to the source, is based on Karl Schaefer Craig Engler’s novel Z Nation.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Personal Details, Career, And Wealth Of Gil Birmingham"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/personal-details-career-and-wealth-of-gil-birmingham/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/personal-details-career-and-wealth-of-gil-birmingham/"}{"1":65}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Personal Details, Career, And Wealth Of Gil Birmingham</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag>voice actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Leonora Balcarce</a></h3>Leonora Balcarce estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
