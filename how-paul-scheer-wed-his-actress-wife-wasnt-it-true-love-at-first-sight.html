This pair is steadfast in their desire to spend their lives together as well as in their shared sense of humor.</strong></p><p>They have been a couple for almost ten years, and they have two children altogether, making their own family of four. He was ignored by his wife, both as a friend and as a long-term partner.</p><p>Paul-Scheer, an American actor, has been happily married for almost ten years. Paul, who is also a writer and producer, was married to June Diane Raphael, an actress best known for appearing in comedies like Burning Love.</p><p>Even though they have been together for a while, these two lovers did not fall in love right away. Paul claims that when they first met in 2004 at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Manhattan, June had entirely disregarded his existence.</p><p>Paul had previously offered June and her friend Casey Wilson assistance with their comedy performance “Rode Hard and Put Away Wet” during that period. Despite her initial lack of interest, June eventually invited him out to lunch to thank him for his assistance.</p><p>The only thing Paul ended up ordering on their first unofficial lunch date was water. Due to their historical love engagement with other individuals, the couple’s relationship may have developed slowly.</p><p>However, their friendship grew over time, and when they went on their first official date, doubts began to creep in. Fortunately or unfortunately, two of their buddies interrupted their date, which led to everyone dancing to 80s music.</p><p>Paul remembered that their first date to LA WeeklyOpens a New Window in January was unexpectedly warm. As it turned out, he had walked June to her apartment and kissed her just before they split ways.</p><p>Paul-Scheer, who has a <strong>$1 million</strong> net worth, was at first perplexed but quickly got the hang of things. The following year, Pual and June relocated from New York to Los Angeles to set up residence there. Years later, they added a title to their relationship, which continued to be strong.</p><p>The couple exchanged their vows in a modest ceremony at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. On October 5, 2009, their union as husband and wife was declared.</p><h2>Four Happily Blissful People Are A Blessing</h2><p>As their marriage was going well, the couple quickly decided they wanted to start a family of their own. The addition of a new family member made them very happy. In 2014, the couple welcomed their first child together after five years of marriage.</p><p>They joyfully embraced motherhood on April 30 when they brought their elder son Gus into the world. They both actively participated in parenting their first child together.</p><p>The couple made plans for Gus to have a sibling when he was two years old. Sam, the second son June and Pual have, was born in August 2016 and has a net worth of <strong>$1 million</strong>. For the seasoned parents, taking care of their second child was easier than taking care of their first.</p><p>Despite all the effort, the two loved every minute of it—especially Paul, who June claims changed more diapers than she did.<br>It turns out that the Pual is heavily involved. As for June, she claims that she “feels just right” in the house full of lads.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Tom Stenberg</a>, <a href=#>Cyrus Michael Christopher Dancy</a>, and <a href=#>Morgane Stapleton</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Comedian</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Alyzeh Gabol- Wiki, Height, Net Worth, Husband</a></h3>Alyzeh Gabol is a well-known actor, model, businesswoman, and social media influencer from Pakistan.
