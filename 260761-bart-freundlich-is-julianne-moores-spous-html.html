In an interview with Indiewire on the release of his first full-length film, he <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.indiewire.com/1997/01/an-interview-with-bart-freundlich-83573/>said:</a></p><p class=Fg>"On my film I had a lot of control in terms of the process and development....I want people to have trust for my skill as a director."</p><p class=Fg>While Freundlich is not Fox, he does have a lot going for him too! In 1994, he wrote and directed a short film titled "A Dog Race in Alaska," as well as a documentary called "Hired Hands."</p><p class=Fg>It was until his first full-length film, "The Myth of Fingerprints," came out in 1997 that he started to get recognition for his work. The film, which starred Freundlich's wife, Moore, Blythe Danner, and Roy Scheider, received awards at the Sundance Film Festival following its release.</p><p class=Fg>Since then, Freundlich has also worked on other productions. Other Bart Freundlich movies include "World Traveler" (2001), "Catch That Kid" (2004), "Trust the Man" (2005), and "After The Wedding" in 2019.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>In 2020, the actress shared their secret to having a happy, fulfilling, and long-lasting relationship.</strong></h3><p class=Fg>Freundlich is also a director for the not-yet-released anthological drama "With/In," which is set to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>THEIR LOVE STORY</strong></p><p class=Fg>In 1996, Freundlich and Moore met for the first time on the set of the movie "The Myth of Fingerprints." They started dating shortly after too.</p><p class=Fg>Moore played the role of Mia alongside Scheider and Danner in the movie that chronicled one dysfunctional family's Thanksgiving experience. In an on-stage interview in 2019, Moore narrated the hilarious way she and her director-turned-husband met and hit it off. She<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k081Dpx6hjw"> explained:</a></p><p class=Fg>"I was supposed to meet him in a hotel to talk about it, but my car broke down. I had a lot of reasons to be grumpy. He was so patient, and I was just awful!"</p><p class=Fg>When she asked Freundlich why he wanted her for the movie, he said that he noticed she could be two completely different people, when her face was in complete repose and when she smiled.</p><p class=Fg>The duality in physicality was one of the main reasons he thought she fit the role. The reason struck Moore and convinced her to work with him.</p><p class=Fg>Little did she know that <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/photo-gallery/26174521/image/29020163/Aug-2003-when-Julianne-Moore-Bart-Freundlich-exchanged>nearly seven years later</a>, she would be getting married to him and that they would even go on to have a family together.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>BEAUTIFUL MARRIAGE AND FAMILY</strong></p><p class=Fg>In 1997, Freundlich and Moore welcomed their first child together. Their son, Caleb, was born in December 1997, only about a year after they started dating. In April 2002, they welcomed their second child, their daughter, Liv.</p><p class=Fg>A year after they had their daughter, the lovebirds decided it was time to take things a little further. Julianne Moore and Bart Freundlich's wedding came in August 2003, and they started a new life as husband and wife in Greenwich Village, New York City.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>WORKING TOGETHER</strong></p><p class=Fg>In the movie "After The Wedding," which Freundlich directed, Moore starred as Theresa Young. The movie, which was a remake of the Danish-Jewish filmmaker Susanne Bier's Oscar-nominated drama of the same name, was the husband and wife's fourth time working together.</p><p class=Fg>Despite the challenges that many would expect when working with family, Freundlich had no reservations about it. In a talk with The JC author Stephen Applebaum, he <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thejc.com/culture/film/bart-freundlich-film-director-i-d-be-crazy-not-to-cast-my-wife-julianne-moore-1.490883>said:</a></p><p class=Fg>"[When Moore watched the film, she was] totally taken."</p><p class=Fg>Working on the movie meant Freundlich had to rewrite it as the remake was set to swap the two main characters' genders. Describing what their on-set relationship is like, Freundlich <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bart-freundlich-directing-julianne-moore-wedding-1157345>said to The Hollywood Reporter:</a></p><p class=Fg>"There is no one I'd rather work with. She's just the best at what she does. So I knew to be smart enough to let her do her thing and to contribute where I could."</p><p class=Fg>On working with him, Moore also admitted to being in tune with her husband's mood on-set and away. She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/julianne-moore-fourth-movie-with-husband-highly-sensitive-moods/>described working with him</a> as familiar and understanding.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>MOORE ON MARRIAGE</strong></p><p class=Fg>After being married for nearly two decades, the iconic Julianne Moore-Bart Freundlich duo has only continued to flourish and grow over the years.</p><p class=Fg>An insider opened up about their beautiful marriage and how happy they are to Us Weekly.
