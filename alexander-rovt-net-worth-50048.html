His <a href=#>Father</a> was a manager at a knitting factory and his mother a housewife. He grew up across the nearby border in <a href=#>Hungary</a> and then attended the Lviv Academy of Commerce in the <a href=#>Ukraine</a> where he graduated with a degree in <a href=#>Business</a> and later received a PhD in international economics. After school, he worked as a manager for the state-owned vegetable distributor in <a href=#>Hungary</a> but was soon arrested due to his capitalistic <a href=#>Business</a> tendencies; in 1985, he fled to the United States with his wife and settled in Brooklyn where he worked in his uncleâ€™s kosher deli and at a cousinâ€™s jewelry store.</p><span>1988</span><p>In 1988, Rovt took a job at IBE Trade which was founded by Sheldon Silverston. IBE made a profit by selling goods to governments that were not in favor with the international community and as a result, did not have ready access to hard currency. IBE was paid in hard commodities rather than cash (e.g. steel, coffee). Thanks to Rovtâ€™s connections in the Eastern bloc and understanding of the fertilizer <a href=#>Business</a> thanks to his involvement at the vegetable distributor, IBE expanded it operations to the Soviet Union supplying goods in exchange for fertilizer, something the Soviets had in abundance thanks to ample natural gas supplies, a primary input to the manufacture of fertilizer. Once Perestroika took hold, the barter <a href=#>Business</a> diminished and Rovt (along with his childhood friend and co-worker at IBE, Imre Pakh) bought IBE from Silverston and transitioned the company into a traditional fertilizer distributor eventually controlling 85-90% of the fertilizer trade in <a href=#>Russia</a> and the <a href=#>Ukraine</a> by 2000.</p><span>1999</span><p>In 1999, Rovt purchased a deteriorating fertilizer plant in <a href=#>Bulgaria</a> on the condition that he spend $100 million over five years on renovations. The company was losing money due to high natural gas prices which were then trading at market prices. Rovt sold a 25% stake in the company to the <a href=#>Energy</a> <a href=#>Billionaire</a> <a href=#>Igor Makarov</a> from Turkmenistan who agreed to supply the plant with natural gas at discounted price. He also sold 10% to local <a href=#>Bulgarian</a> partners. Unbeknownst to him, his <a href=#>Bulgarian</a> partners were able to seize control of the facility by transferring ownership of the plant to an offshore company in <a href=#>Cyprus</a>. His friend and partner Pakh sold his interest in IBE to Rovt after one of his <a href=#>Bulgarian</a> partners was murdered. Rovt sued in the US to recover his plant and received a favorable decision but the judgment was not honored in <a href=#>Bulgaria</a>.</p><span>2000</span><p>Despite his unfavorable foray into fertilizer plant ownership in <a href=#>Bulgaria</a>, he purchased several more fertilizer plants in the 2000s which both became very lucrative <a href=#>Investments</a>. The first was in Rossosh, <a href=#>Russia</a> in partnership with Igor Olshansky, the son of a member of the Duma (in whose district the plant was located) and the <a href=#>Norwegian</a> agricultural company Yara International. In 2004, IBE purchased a plant in Severodonetsk, <a href=#>Ukraine</a> in return for an investment commitment of $120 million. In 2005, after the Orange Revolution, a court voided the sale; Rovt, with the assistance of the US government, was eventually able to have the decision reversed and the plant is operating profitably with the consent of the <a href=#>Ukrainian</a> government.</p><span>2007</span><p>In 2007, wanting to secure his wealth, he purchased the <a href=#>Bankers</a> Trust Building from Joshua Zamir for $303 million in cash and sold his remaining overseas fertilizer assets to <a href=#>Ukrainian</a> <a href=#>Billionaire</a> Dmitry Firtash. He now has a portfolio of 280 buildings mostly in New York City.</p><span>2015</span><p>http://uzhgorod.in/en/news/2015/fevral/mini_monument_to_michael_strank_was_opened_in_uzhgorod_photos_video</p><span>2019</span><p>He lives on Manhattanâ€™s Upper East Side with his wife Olga in a five-story, 12,000-square-foot building constructed out of reinforced concrete with brick facing and retractable bulletproof shades covering the windows. He has two children: Philip (born 1978) and <a href=#>Maxwell</a> (born 1987).</p><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>American investors</a> <a href=#>American Jews</a> <a href=#>American philanthropists</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>American billionaires</a> <a href=#>1952 births</a> <a href=#>People from Mukacheve</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeRobK5rc2dnKtloqTDtXnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5lGlnbXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./anthony-joshua-tattoos-meanings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anthony Joshua's tattoos include the outline of Africa and the Team GB lion, but what do they all me">&larr;
