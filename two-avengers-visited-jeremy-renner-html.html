Neece">Kevin C. Neece</a> | <span class=date>Updated 10 months ago</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/jeremy-renner-hawkeye-avengers-barton-900x506.jpg><p>Last month, following Jeremy Renner’s near-fatal snowplow accident, his Avengers costars Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans came to see him. <a href=#>Variety</a> reports that the Black Widow and <a href=#>Captain America</a> actors went to see their fellow <a href=#>Marvel</a> alum as he continues to recover from his January 1 accident, during which he was run over by a snowcat that weighs some seven tons. Renner has been making a remarkably speedy recovery and his superhero pals are amazed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/scarlett-johansson-chris-evans-nanny-diaries-900x473.jpeg><p>As Scarlett Johansson told Variety, the Avengers text chain—which includes Jeremy Renner, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, <a href=#>Mark Ruffalo</a>, and <a href=#>Robert Downey Jr.</a>—was abuzz following the accident, with his costars all expressing their encouragement for the Hawkeye actor. “That’s it,” Johansson says they agreed, “You won,” calling Renner’s rebound from the harrowing incident “real superhero stuff.” Indeed, the actor has shown not just incredible physical strength during this time but strength of character and spirit as well.</p><p>Chris Evans related that when he and Scarlett Johansson visited Jeremy Renner, there were “no tears at all,” and that the event was marked with hugs and laughter, highlighting Renner’s ability to turn a tragedy into a hopeful, joyful journey. His interview with Diane Sawyer last month highlighted his inspiring determination and positive attitude, which have not only been essential to his healing but have inspired those around him as well.</p><p>In the exclusive interview, Sawyer highlighted Renner’s connection to and investment in his home community of Reno, Mt. Rose in Washoe County, Nevada, including a pair of friends who joined him for a loving video chat that highlighted his service and deep ties with his neighbors.</p><p>Jeremy Renner’s ties to his Avengers family are also strong, as Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans both attested to their worry at the news of the accident, followed by the hopeful reports of Renner’s prognosis and the encouraging journey of his continued healing. The remarkable strength shown by the action star has exceeded, in their view, anything seen on screen. And, as Sawyer’s interview highlighted, his strength lies not just within himself, but is drawn from his family and friends, as well as medical professionals who have rallied around him during this crisis.</p><p>At the time of the accident, as Scarlett Johansson relates, she, Chris Evans, and the other cast members didn’t know if they would see Jeremy Renner again. There was every possibility his injuries—which included fractures of his right knee, ankle, and shoulder, eight ribs, and dozens of other breaks, along with a rib piercing his liver and a collapsed lung—could have ended his life. But Renner’s remarkable resilience and the dedication of doctors, nurses, and surgeons won the day, much to the relief of his family, costars, and fans around the world.</p><p>Scarlett Johansson calls Jeremy Renner “very spiritual” and “very soulful,” saying that when she and Chris Evans visited, there was a lot of laughter and joy. Such joy is warranted as Renner has recovered enough to have been present for the premiere of his new Disney+ series Rennervations, which follows the actor’s travels as he repurposes discarded vehicles to help communities around the world. That giving, loving spirit of renovation and renewal has been essential to Renner’s <a href=#>unbelievable progress</a> and shows a heroism the movies can’t beat.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnpKy8bq3VnqWgnaKoere10qKrnpxdn7KzscyyZKudnqOys3rHraSl</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./married-at-first-sight-season-15.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Married at First Sight' Season 15 Is Happening  Here's Everything We Know">&larr;
