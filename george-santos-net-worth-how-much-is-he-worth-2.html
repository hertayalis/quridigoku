Santos entered a not-guilty plea to those accusations after using deception in part of his campaign to win his congressional seat.</p><h2><strong>Who Is George Santos?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>George Santos, also known as George Anthony Devolder Santos, is a highly respected American politician currently serving as the U.S. representative for New York’s 3rd congressional district. It is worth mentioning that he is the first openly LGBT member elected to Congress as a Republican.</p><p>Santos was born on the 22nd of July, 1988, to Fátima Aziza Caruso Horta Devolder and Gercino Antônio dos Santos Jr. Santos. He received his formal education at Intermediate School 125, situated in Woodside, Queens, and Primary School 122 in Astoria, Queens.</p><h2><strong>George Santos Career</strong></h2><p>While there was a case pending against him for cheque fraud, Santos fled Brazil and moved to NYC where he spent October 2011 to July 2012 working as a customer support agent for Dish Network. Santos worked for HotelsPro, a division of MetGlobal, a company based in Istanbul, Turkey, which was later found to have a lot of unfavourable internet ratings. The New York Times confirmed this information at some point around 2013.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After relocating to Orlando, Florida, in early 2016, Santos changed his driver’s licence to reflect his Florida residency and registered to vote. HotelsPro was opening an office in Orlando. He started employment with the Florida-based alternative investment business Harbour City Capital sometime in January 2020, not long after he announced his first congressional bid in November 2019.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>In his first congressional campaign, Santos established a Harbour City Capital office. He took over as the company’s regional director for New York a month later. In an interview from 2020, he stated that he oversaw $1.5 billion in assets for Harbour City, with an internal rate of return of 26% and a fixed yield income return of 12%. Santos established the Devolder Organisation after Harbour City paid him at least through April 2021; he has stated that this organisation is the source of his wealth.</p><h2><strong>George Santos Legal Issues</strong></h2><p>Santos has been formally charged with 23 counts of fraud in two federal indictments earlier this year in 2023. The amended 23-count indictment further includes two additional fraudulent schemes: the credit card scheme and the conspiracy to file false reports to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) with the intention of inflating his campaign’s funding. This deceitful act was aimed at deceiving the Republican party into providing financial support.</p><p>Santos stands accused of devising a plan to unlawfully obtain the identities and bank account details of his campaign contributors. This scheme involved charging their credit cards and diverting the funds into his personal bank account, as well as other campaigns and his own campaign. On October 27, 2023, Santos is scheduled to appear in federal court, where it is expected that new charges will be brought against him.</p><h2><strong>George Santos Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Santos’ net worth as of 2023 is estimated to be a little above $11 million. This includes all his assets and political earnings.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCzxKipoJ1dqK6vwM6sZKedpGLEsL7ToWShp6diuravx2agrGWYmnq4u9Gtn2ZqXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-lil-scrappy-from-love-hip-hop-married-does-he-have-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Lil Scrappy From Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop Married?
