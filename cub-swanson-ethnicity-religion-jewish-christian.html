The talented American fighter received fame for competing in the bantamweight, lightweight, and featherweight divisions in the Ultimate Fighting Championship.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He was born on 2 November 1983. He is originally from <span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">Palm Springs, California, United States</span>, representing his hometown.</span></p><p>He has competed in the <span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">Bantamweight category since 2022. Likewise, he represented the lightweight division from 2004 to 2006 and the featherweight division from 2006 to 2021.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The charismatic professional MMA fighter’s stance is Orthodox. People know him for representing <span class="wHYlTd z8gr9e">Jackson Wink MMA </span>until 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eventually, the American fighter shot to fame after achieving impressive 28-13-0 stats in UFC. People know him as “The Killer.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kevin Luke “Cub” Swanson, 39, was ranked #16 among the 2022 featherweight UFC rankings worldwide. He dominated in other categories as well.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, Swanson is a family man, as he tied the knot with Kenda Perez in 2018. The two are parents to their three kids, <span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">Royal Rae Swanson, King Cub Swanson, and Saint Cub Swanson.</span></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Swanson’s latest match is on Sunday, 13 August 2023. He will compete in </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The UFC Fight Night Featherweight Co-main event </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>against Hakeem Dawodu.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The former lightweight fighter has an Instagram account with over 372 thousand followers as of this writing.

The former #16 UFC featherweight star amassed many followers through his skilful fighting talent.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to the sources, Swanson was born and raised in <span class=ILfuVd lang=en><span class=hgKElc>Palm Springs, California</span></span>.&nbsp;</span>Reportedly, his father, Steven Swanson, is of Swedish origin, and his mother is Mexican.&nbsp;</p><p>So, he is of mixed origin, having Swedish, Mexican, and American ancestry. Eventually<span data-preserver-spaces=true>, he developed his fighting passion into a career and learnt the fighting discipline.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He still fights out of his hometown in <span class=ILfuVd lang=en><span class=hgKElc>Palm Springs, California</span></span>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As his surname is not common in America, barely any website has associated its ancestry. But his last name, Swanson, is of Scottish and English origin.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cub-Swanson-Ethnicity-And-Religion.webp><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, UFC star Cub Swanson has rarely answered questions regarding his religious sentiments and faith. It is common for MMA fighters like him to not involve in religious conflict and reveal their faith.</span></p><p>However, reports suggest that <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Swanson grew up in a religious family. His family members were believers in God, and he spent most of his early life in the church.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Likewise, he was homeschooled for most of his childhood.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, Swanson isn’t much invested in publicly revealing his origin and ancestry as he seems more focused on his fighting career. He has settled himself as a threatening opponent in UFC.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While the fighter’s ethnicity and religion may interest his followers, what matters most is talent and hard work to improve his stats further.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Thanks to his constant dedication, Swanson improves regularly even at this age and becomes the man he is today.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Read More:&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Justin Gaethje Tattoo: How Many Body Inks Does He Have?</span></a></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Cub Swanson Family And Married Life</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Swanson’s supporters are keen to learn about the love of his life.
