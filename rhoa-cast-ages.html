Whether they discuss marriages, divorces, money, or legal troubles, the Atlanta ladies rarely hold back from sharing their personal lives.</p><p>The RHOA cast doesn’t shy away from having conversations (or throwing shade) about aging, either. On the show, many cast members, such as <a href=#>Kenya Moore</a> and <a href=#>Porsha Williams</a>, openly shared their experiences of giving birth to their daughters (Brooklyn and Pilar, respectively) later in life. Others, like <a href=#>Cynthia Bailey</a>, remarried Mike Hill at age 53. Although they’re making strides at any age, some Bravo fans may not know how old the cast members are. Here’s what we know about the RHOA cast’s ages.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kandi Burruss — 45</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>While <a href=#>Kandi</a> wasn’t a part of RHOA Season 1, the 45-year-old reality star has consistently held her peach since her Season 2 debut. When she first joined the cast, fans recognized her as one of the singers of Xscape and the Grammy-winning writer of songs like “No Scrubs” by TLC. However, Kandi expanded her career through her reality TV fame.</p><p>Some of her accolades include multiple RHOA spinoffs, winning The Masked Singer Season 2, and acting roles in The Chi and Lifetime’s Envy: A Seven Deadly Sins Story. On RHOA, Kandi — who was born on May 17, 1976 — often shares her struggles of balancing her career with her responsibilities as a wife and mother to her husband, Todd Tucker, and their kids: Riley, Kayla, Ace, and Blaze.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shereé Whitfield — 52</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Born on Jan. 2, 1970, <a href=#>Shereé</a> became a full-time cast member of RHOA when it first premiered in October 2008. The 52-year-old She by Shereé designer adjusted to life as a single mother of three following her divorce from Bob Whitfield during her initial seasons. After four seasons on RHOA, Shereé left the show but returned as a “friend” in Season 8 before becoming a peach holder again in Season 9. However, she made another exit in Season 10.</p><p>Amid her third return to the series, Shereé will share her relationship with her boyfriend, Tyrone Gilliams. The pair began dating while Tyrone served time in prison for wire fraud schemes, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Out</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Marlo Hampton — 46</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>The longtime “friend” of the show is one of the newest full-time cast members.
