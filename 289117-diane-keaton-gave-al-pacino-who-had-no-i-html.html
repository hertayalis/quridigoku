The meeting was to allow the two stars to get to know each other better before auditioning for "The Godfather."</p><p class=dh>Keaton was nervous, and the first thing she noticed about Pacino was his nose, which she likened to a cucumber with Roman features. She also picked up that he was nervous too, and she didn't recall discussing the script.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/8ea5210282a25a6c3a63a204f2eccd39.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Diane Keaton and Al Pacino starring in "The Godfather," in 1972. | Source: FilmPublicityArchive/United Archives/Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=3g27QvwJCnAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=THEN+AGAIN++By+Diane+Keaton&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=al%20pacino&f=false">thought</a> Pacino had a "remarkable face."
